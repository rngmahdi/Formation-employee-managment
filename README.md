This project is made as a exam for react. Focusing on managing formations for employees. Each employee can participate in one or more formations. The project utilizes React for the frontend, styled with Tailwind CSS and enhanced with components from AntDesign. For the backend, a JSON file is used as the database, and json-server is employed to serve the JSON file as an API. This setup allows for efficient management and retrieval of employee formation data.
For the interface here how it looks:
